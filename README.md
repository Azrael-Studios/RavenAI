This is RavenAI. She is an experimental AI made for testing for an upcoming project. Her backend is ASP.NET Core WebApi and her frontend is Flutter.
She uses MongoDB for her backend. At the moment, it is a locally hosted version. In the future, I will transition to a web-based service but that mey not happen with Raven.
