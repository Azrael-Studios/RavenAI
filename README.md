# RavenAI

This is RavenAI. She is an experimental AI made for testing for an upcoming project. Her backend is ASP.NET Core WebApi and her frontend is Flutter.
She uses MongoDB for her backend. At the moment, it is a locally hosted version. In the future, I will transition to a web-based service but that mey not happen with Raven.

To try out, ensure you have MongoDB, the .NET 7 sdk and the Flutter sdk. Then, run `git clone https://github.com/Azrael-Studios/RavenAI/`. If you would like to contribute, please contact me before running `git pull`.

You need ngrok (or similar). Make sure the endpoint matches the one found in `ravenfront\lib\api\constants.dart`.
